[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@lunaticsatoshi%2Flor-sdk-test.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lunaticsatoshi/lor-sdk-test)

## Installation

```
npm install @lunaticsatoshi/lor-sdk-test
```

## Usage

> Use One API's [Getting Started Guide](https://the-one-api.dev/documentation) to get set up to use LOR API.

Import and initialize a client using an **integration token** or an OAuth **access token**.

```js
const { Client } = require("@lunaticsatoshi/lor-sdk-test")
// Modern js
import { Client } from "@lunaticsatoshi/lor-sdk-test"

// Initializing a client
const notion = new Client({
  auth: process.env.NOTION_TOKEN,
})
```

### Make a request to All Movies.

> See the complete list of endpoints in the [API reference](https://the-one-api.dev/documentation).

```js
(async () => {
  const client = new Client({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    baseUrl: 'BASE_URL',
  });

  const response = await client.movies.getMovies();

  console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(response, null, 4)));
})();
```

Each method returns a `Promise` which resolves the response.
